# Squeeze Theorem
Ever felt like it would be nice if you had less health? Thought about taking advantage of One-Shot Protection a little bit? Or maybe you just want some armor. If any of these apply to you, come grab my new lunar item, Squeeze Theorem! It converts health you get from leveling up into armor. with just a little healing, this item can make you really hard to kill.
